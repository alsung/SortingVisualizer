Sorting Visualizer (React App)

This project is from Cl√©ment Mihailescu's 
Sorting Visualizer project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXYym4Wbkc. 
The project produces an array of 300 various values which
correspond to the height of a bar. By clicking on the 'Generate New Array'
button, the values of the 300 bars in the array changes to a random number 
between 5 and 730. When the Merge Sort button is pressed, you will see the 
program run and visually sort the arrays of bars into ascending order.
